      <h2>A Remarkable Milestone in Innovation</h2>
      <p><strong>Unisa celebrates a remarkable milestone, with over a hundred patents granted for inventions that stem from its ongoing research and development efforts.</strong> Since the launch of the Directorate of Innovation, Technology Transfer and Commercialisation (DITTC) in 2012, the university has worked closely with both staff and students to transform fresh ideas into protected technologies.</p>

      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
        <img src="https://ext.same-assets.com/4026891959/1160493728.jpeg" alt="Patent Certificate" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;" />
      </div>

      <h2>Breakthrough Technology: Nanofluids by Radiolysis</h2>
      <p>Among the patents granted, Unisa achieved this milestone: <strong>"Production of Nanofluids by Radiolysis"</strong>, which was granted in South Africa on 22 December 2023. This technology, developed by Prof Maalik Maaza and Dr Touria Khamliche, provides an innovative method and system for manufacturing nanofluids that ensures stable, large-scale production of nano-particle-enhanced liquids with superior heat transfer and performance properties. This breakthrough paves the way for innovations in cooling systems, energy, automotive, and biomedical applications.</p>

      <h2>DITTC's Tremendous Progress</h2>
      <p>The DITTC has made tremendous progress in the promotion and support of innovative solutions and inventions from Unisa's research and development activities. The directorate was established in 2012 in response to the promulgation of the Intellectual Property (IP) from Publicly Financed Research and Development Act 51 of 2008. The DITTC also supports the progressive realisation of the university by ensuring that the excellent work done by Unisa staff and students finds expression in society.</p>

      <h2>Patent Application Growth</h2>
      <p>Following the first invention disclosure in 2012, which led to the institution's first patent application, Unisa has filed an average of 21 patent applications per year. As at the end of 2024, the DITTC processed 251 IP disclosures and filed 251 patent applications in different jurisdictions across the world. This has led to the protection of more than 50 technologies from Unisa's research and development initiatives. Handling innovative solutions from high-tech areas to translation and learning-related technical solutions, the DITTC continues to attract researchers from all colleges at Unisa.</p>

      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

      </div>

      <h2>100 Patents Granted Milestone</h2>
      <p>In 2023, Unisa reached another milestone: 100 patents were granted. From the very first patent to be granted in the name of Unisa in 2015, to a record-breaking 100 patents granted in 2023, the patent portfolio currently stands at 132 patents, filed in South Africa and other parts of the world.</p>

      <div style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">

      </div>

      <h2>Quality and International Protection</h2>
      <p>This growth in granted patents reflects the quality of Unisa's inventions and the internal assessment processes to ensure that those inventions with applications beyond South Africa are adequately protected. With the growth of the portfolio comes an increase in administrative requirements. Patent protection is territorial, and each application filed in each jurisdiction is treated as a separate application and dealt with in terms of the laws of that jurisdiction. Most Unisa patents are granted in examining jurisdictions where the merits of the applications are examined. The DITTC leads the process of navigating through the legal requirements in each jurisdiction, including responding to comments and objections from the various patent offices.</p>

      <h2>Ongoing Engagement</h2>
      <p>The DITTC continues its intensive engagement with researchers, distinguished professors, departments and postgraduate students to create awareness of the IP policy and the importance of protecting innovations emerging from Unisa's research and development activities.</p>

      <h2>Groundbreaking Research on Rooibos Extract</h2>
      <p><strong>October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and there's some good news on the horizon in South Africa.</strong> Stellenbosch University's Dr Nicky Verhoog is leading a study to assess the impact of Rooibos extract in breast cancer treatment. Early results suggest Rooibos extract may limit estrogen's role in promoting breast cancer cell growth.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Understanding the Research</h2>
      <p>In 2023, Harvard Medical School reported that estrogen stimulates breast tissue division and rapid multiplication, raising the risk of cancer-causing mutations.</p>

      <p>The <em>Knysna-Plett Herald</em> reports Rooibos extract showed reactions to estrogen similar to fulvestrant, a drug used to block estrogen in breast cancer treatment.</p>

      <p>The extract was found to slow down estrogen-induced cell growth and prevent the cells from spreading.</p>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #a4ba36; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
        "Our recent research has found that Rooibos extract may counter the effects of estrogen in breast cancer cells. Estrogen is known to fuel the growth of many breast cancers, making these early findings especially significant. In laboratory tests, we found that Rooibos slowed down the growth of estrogen-driven breast cancer cells and stopped them from spreading."
        <footer style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: normal; font-weight: 600;">— Dr Nicky Verhoog, Stellenbosch University</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>A Safe Complementary Approach</h2>
      <p>While these findings are encouraging, the researchers say they don't intend to find a cure, but rather to determine if rooibos is safe to use alongside well-established treatments.</p>

      <p>The next step is additional studies on animals, which are scheduled for 2026.</p>

      <p>Verhoog says that because the lab studies are focused on single cells, they can't replicate the complexity of the human body.</p>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #a4ba36; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
        "We need to see how Rooibos behaves when metabolised in the body."
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Support for the Research</h2>
      <p>Given the potential for a breakthrough in breast cancer treatment, the South African Rooibos Council (SARC) and the Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) Sector Innovation Fund Programme are supporting the research.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>SARIMA Awards Ceremony</h2>
      <p>The SARIMA awards were presented at a special dinner held as part of the annual SARIMA Conference, which ran from 2 to 5 September in Stellenbosch. The awards recognise excellence in research and innovation management across the Southern African Development Community.</p>

      <p>Addressing the attendees, SARIMA President-Elect Dr Douglas Sanyahumbi said that the award to NIPMO celebrated national innovation enablement.</p>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #a4ba36; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
        "It recognises an organisation that serves as a true architect and catalyst for excellence across the national innovation management landscape, whose contributions are considered profound and far-reaching."
        <footer style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: normal; font-weight: 600;">— Dr Douglas Sanyahumbi, SARIMA President-Elect</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <p>He added that NIPMO's work was foundational to the success of every technology transfer office (TTO) in South Africa. "Their impact is not measured in the performance of one institution or one TTO, but in the strength and capability of an entire national innovation system," he said.</p>

      <h2>The Role of Technology Transfer Offices</h2>
      <p>The TTOs function as intermediaries between academic research and the commercial market by managing and commercialising institutional intellectual property (IP). This includes protecting IP through patents and copyrights, licensing technology to existing companies, and assisting in the creation of new spinout companies.</p>

      <h2>NIPMO's Impact on South Africa's Innovation Ecosystem</h2>
      <p>As the national oversight body supporting 37 publicly funded research institutions, NIPMO provides critical financial and strategic support. This includes the allocation of funds to enable institutions to recruit essential technology transfer personnel, implement operational systems, and pursue IP commercialisation. NIPMO also reimburses institutions for eligible IP protection expenses.</p>

      <p>Beyond funding, NIPMO has made remarkable strides in capacity building. It has delivered specialised IP training to over 2,400 individuals from 51 countries and, in collaboration with World Intellectual Property Organization, established 27 technology and innovation support centres across the country, ensuring access to global patent information and innovation support services.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Message from NIPMO Leadership</h2>
      <p>The Head of NIPMO, Ms Jetane Charsley, said that NIPMO and the DSTI were deeply honoured to receive the award.</p>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #a4ba36; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
        "This recognition affirms the collective efforts of our team and partners in building and strengthening a national innovation system that is inclusive and sustainable. We share this award with every TTO, researcher and stakeholder working tirelessly to translate ideas into impact for South Africa and beyond."

      <h2>Portfolio Committee Briefing Overview</h2>
      <p><strong>Science, Technology and Innovation</strong><br/>
      <strong>11 March 2025</strong><br/>
      <strong>Chairperson:</strong> Ms T Shiviti (ANC)</p>

      <h2>Meeting Summary</h2>
      <p>The Committee was briefed by the Department of Science, Technology and Innovation and the National Intellectual Property Management Office (NIPMO) on the Intellectual Property from Publicly Financed Research and Development Act (IPR Act).</p>

      <p>Dr Blade Nzimande, the Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, said when the Department was first formed in 1994, one of its aims was to strengthen the country's innovation capabilities, identifying strategic weaknesses in the innovation system. An example of this could be research which hardly translated to commercialisation and intellectual property (IP). Most of the innovators consisted of the poor and working-class communities. To address the aforementioned weakness, several innovation-enabling legislative, institutional measures were in place. This included the creation of the Technology of the Innovation Agency which was for innovative IPs commercialisation from research products. The Intellectual Property from Publicly Funded Research and Development Act was passed in 2008.</p>

      <h2>Key Issues Discussed</h2>
      <p>The Committee wondered about an instance where someone acquired Intellectual Property (IP) and a large corporation challenged the originality of the IP. The Committee raised concerns about the theft of IP in the country by international companies. They asked about the beneficiaries of the NIPMO, specifically the small enterprises, and what impact the NIPMO made on local economic development. The Committee was alarmed at the allocations which were at only 3% of the budget to support millions, yet 78% was spent on salaries alone.</p>

      <h2>Minister's Opening Remarks</h2>
      <p>Dr Blade Nzimande, Minister of Science, Technology and Innovation, greeted everyone and said he would switch off his video due to having poor internet connection. He looked forward to the presentation and appreciated the support provided by the Committee on the latest Tourism Strategy.</p>

      <p>When the Department was first formed in 1994, one of its aims was to strengthen the country's innovation capabilities, identifying strategic weakness in the innovation system namely; the innovation 'chasm'. An example of this could be research which hardly translated to commercialisation and intellectual property (IP). Most of the innovators consisted of the poor and working-class communities.</p>

      <h2>Addressing the Innovation Chasm</h2>
      <p>To address the aforementioned weakness, several innovation-enabling legislative institutional measures were in place. This included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The creation of the Technology Innovation Agency for innovative IP commercialisation from research products</li>
        <li>The Intellectual Property from Publicly Funded Research and Development Act passed in 2008</li>
        <li>Establishment of NIPMO to ensure research funded by public funds was identified, protected and utilised for public benefit</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Historical Context and Examples</h2>
      <p>The Minister recalled the discovery of insulin in 1928. The professor who founded the insulin was paid only $2. He wondered how many billions of Rand were generated from the pharmaceutical companies that used and sold insulin for the purpose of treating diabetes. He questioned whether the University of Toronto was still benefiting from this.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property Leakage</h2>
      <p>Another problem which the Department sought to address was the Intellectual Property leakage; this referred to unauthorised disclosure of an organisation which was appropriated by other organisations. This leakage occurred through many means: data breaches, poor security practices, and ethical actions of an employee working for the organisation by means of plagiarism.</p>

      <h3>South African Examples</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Optimal Energy Joule (2010):</strong> South Africa produced the first electric car in the world, called the Optimal Energy Joule, but this was lost due to lack of funding and weak management. The car won many international awards.</li>
        <li><strong>Rooibos Tea:</strong> An American company wanted to patent the Rooibos tea as an American product</li>
        <li><strong>Please Call Me:</strong> A former Vodacom employee who invented the 'please call me' initiative faced conflict</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The Minister emphasized that much of the IP was stolen from developing countries. South Africa was among the top five of the most biodiverse countries, and of the plant species in the country, only 5% were formally studied. The continent was equally biodiverse; many countries invested in the African continent and committed theft of intellectual property.</p>

      <h2>Innovation Fund and Support for SMMEs</h2>
      <p>The President mentioned the public funding for innovation in the State of the Nation (SONA) last month. The Innovation Fund was established in 2021. Its primary objective was to serve as a catalyst for the creation of the sustained growth of the high technology Small Micro and Medium Enterprises (SMMEs), and to focus on generating sustainable pipeline opportunities of viable high technology for the private sector.</p>

      <p>The Department provided financial support. There was a long-standing debate and discussion on the Bank of South Africa, which was not responding to such initiatives; there was no start-up funding facility, and commercial banks showed no interest in supporting the SMMEs. During the COVID-19 global pandemic, R200,000,000,000 was set aside to assist the SMMEs, and hardly any of that funding reached said enterprises.</p>

      <h2>The Importance of NIPMO</h2>
      <p>NIPMO was integral to unlocking innovation in the country, commercialising it, and supporting it as part of contributing to economic growth and development in the country, especially those in the poor and working-class sectors. The task of protecting IP was strenuous and NIPMO may be out of depth in this regard. The Department may need to enhance the NIPMO.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #6b7280; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Team effort and collaboration: Prof. Rangith Baby Kuriakose, Associate Professor, and Siphiwe Mkhwanazi, Lecturer Assistant and Research Scholar in the Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Computer Systems Engineering, have partnered with Opti-Num Solutions to pioneer a future where simulation, AI, and smart technologies drive innovation and deliver research-based solutions.</em></p>
      </div>

      <h2>Digital Twin Technology</h2>
      <p>Under the tutelage of Prof. Rangith Baby Kuriakose, Associate Professor at CUT, and his team, and in partnership with Opti-Num Solutions, the official vendor of MathWorks tools in Southern Africa, CUT has developed a digital twin of the plant. This live, virtual copy of the physical system, continuously updated by sensor data, creates a safe and extendable research environment where advanced control strategies can be explored. Students and researchers can now compare traditional PLC control, event-driven Stateflow logic, and AI-based reinforcement learning, all without disrupting real-world operations.</p>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #a4ba36; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
        "Digital twins are a powerful way to innovate while offering safe, cost-effective experimentation. It also enables industries to predict failures, optimize performance, and build smarter systems."
        <footer style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: normal; font-weight: 600;">— Prof. Rangith Baby Kuriakose</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>From Concept to Academic Resource</h2>
      <p>A project plan and a scaled-down 3D model of the water bottling plant were first developed, laying the foundation for future research. Building on this plan, a small-scale version of the plant was physically constructed as part of Prof. Kuriakose's Doctoral project.</p>

      <p>Since then, the platform has grown into a significant academic resource, with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Over 15 DHET accredited publications</li>
        <li>Five postgraduate students successfully completing their research</li>
        <li>Research topics including communication architectures, digital twin development, human-machine collaboration, Blockchain technology and 5G technology incorporation</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Impact on Local Industry</h2>
      <p>Looking ahead, the solutions being developed are tailored for small and medium industries in Bloemfontein, Welkom, and across the Free State, empowering them to transition into Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 practices.</p>

      <p>Together with Opti-Num Solutions, Prof. Baby and his team are pioneering a future where simulation, AI, and smart technologies transform how we teach, test, and apply innovation — bridging the academia and industry gaps and reinforcing CUT's role as a hub for human-centred, research-driven solutions.</p>

      <h2>The Key Safeguards</h2>
      <p>As an introduction into understanding the options, Advocate Thato Moloto, who specialises in intellectual property and copyright, explains that if art is your child, intellectual property is how you raise it.</p>

      <p>Moloto broke down the three main types of intellectual property that can protect creations:</p>

      <h3>1. Trademarks</h3>
      <p>For names, logos, and shapes, registered with the <a href="https://www.cipc.co.za/?page_id=4118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">Companies and Intellectual Property Commission (CIPC)</a> in South Africa.</p>

      <h3>2. Patents</h3>
      <p>The registration of new technical solutions to problems, also filed with the CIPC.</p>

      <h3>3. Copyright</h3>
      <p>Covers an original creation that exists in a practical way by giving the creator the rights to authorise who can reproduce, adapt, perform, distribute and sell the creation. It does not require registration, making it particularly tricky to regulate. Copyright, Moloto jokes, is like having a child without a birth certificate.</p>

      <p>This is critical to understand, not only because of the need to protect creations and possibly collect royalties, but also because of the sheer size of the industry. Moloto quotes statistics like the around 120,000 songs released daily on streaming platforms, and that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) estimates that around 2.2 million books are published yearly.</p>

      <h2>Protection Methods</h2>
      <p>There are some key identifiers or ways to protect copyright that are administered by various national and international bodies. For instance:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Books have <a href="https://www.nlsa.ac.za/isbn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">ISBN</a> numbers issued by national libraries</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.doi.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">DOI</a> numbers are for academic texts and the like</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.iswc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">ISWC</a> numbers are for musical compositions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Other ways to protect various forms of work and to track where it has been used include:</p>

      <ul>

      <h2>IP in an AI World</h2>
      <p>An understanding of intellectual property is crucial, particularly in the rapidly changing climate thanks to the rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI). Rachel Sikwane, a commercial lawyer focusing on academic publishing at <a href="https://rnmsinc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">RNMS</a>, explains that institutions and creators are still learning how to respond.</p>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #a4ba36; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
        "As a result of AI and platforms like ChatGPT, a lot of the fundamental IP principles have been challenged and tested."
      </blockquote>

      <p>This includes who counts as the author or inventor of material generated or developed with the help of such tools. Another issue is whether copyrighted materials that have been used to train AI have been done so with permission and compensation. This also brings up whether there is a need for updated guidelines on AI generated content in being used in the academic sphere.</p>

      <p>Sikwane says that one way to approach this is that large academic publishers like Oxford University Press, Taylor & Francis Group, and Wiley Publishers have stepped into large financial licensing deals with AI companies. Also, legal actions in countries like the US, France, and Ireland, are pushing for clarity on these issues.</p>

      <h2>Finding a Way Through the Complexity</h2>
      <p>As numerous as the challenges around intellectual property currently are, this has long been an area of contention and tensions. Lazarus Matizirofa, the Associate Director of Research, Scholarly Communication, Digital Services & Systems at Wits Libraries, points to a number of famous songs that have faced copyright <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waka_Waka_(This_Time_for_Africa)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">controversy</a>, such as Shakira's <em>Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)</em>.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, there are various services available to the Wits community when considering possible intellectual property. Matizirofa says Wits Libraries offer various <a href="https://libguides.wits.ac.za/Copyright_and_Related_Issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">copyright services</a> and consult around using copyright materials. This extends not only to individuals, but Faculties themselves, for instance, around course materials.</p>

      <p>Matizirofa also warns that researchers should be aware of copyright policies that may be linked to their research grants. Wits Libraries can assist with understanding and fulfilling this. He also advises that there are various AI tools available that may be particularly reliable to use in the University setting, such as <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/library/scopus-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">SCOPUS</a>.</p>

      <p>For patents and other intellectual property concerns around innovation and possible commercialisation, the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/innovation/wits-innovation-centre/innovation-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #2563eb; text-decoration: underline;">WIC's Innovation Support</a> office is the recommended point of contact.</p>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #a4ba36; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
        "Our job as a university is obviously to encourage creativity, but it is to safeguard it, so that our ideas, inventions, and music aren't stolen or disappear, but that they thrive and will benefit the people that created them."

      <p>On 24 April 2025, a roadshow was held at the Durban Botanic Gardens which aimed at educating the communities at large about the importance of intellectual property and its role in fostering innovation and creativity, empowering a new generation of innovators and creatives.</p>

      <p>The event was attended by Mr Timothy Magampa, General Manager of Legal and Licensing at Independent Music Performance Rights Association (IMPRA). He delivered a dynamic presentation on the registering of artistic work and the protection of intellectual property. Mr Thando Nyameni, Managing Director of KUMISA, shared his insights on leveraging intellectual property to build successful careers and businesses in the creative industry.</p>

      <p>Dr Thobile Sifunda, Head of Department for Sport, Arts and Culture, welcomed all attendees at the roadshow and highlighted key points for artists to consider which are ownership, control, and management; understanding the value chain; and embracing partnerships.

      </div>

      <p>Day two round off with the multi-talented artist from Ulundi, Ntuthuko Ndebele, known as Mthuthu. He shared on his musical journey and offered advice on navigating the challenges of the music industry. Having encountered numerous challenges himself, Ndebele's insights provided a realistic perspective on what upcoming artists may face, making his words a crucial takeaway for those looking to break into the industry.</p>

      <h3>Event 3: Interactive Workshop at MUT (25 April 2025)</h3>
      <p>The final day of the celebration of the World Intellectual Property (IP) Day 2025 took place at the Mangosuthu University of Technology on 25 April 2025. The day culminated into an interactive workshop which focused on the various practical aspects of intellectual property, with a vast emphasis on the comprehensive understanding of IPs in the music industry, highlighting the contribution of various stakeholders such as SAMRO, NIPMO, LASA and CIPC.</p>

      <p>A dynamic talk on the rights of artists was given by Ms Lerato Moloi, Founder and CEO of Lawyers for the Arts South Africa (LASA), who gave insight into the challenges faced by independent artists when dealing with record labels and also brought to the fore some of her experiences and lessons learned at the World Intellectual Property Day Celebration 2025.</p>

      <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #a4ba36; padding-left: 1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic;">
        "My goal is to create a fair, inclusive and legally empowered creative industry in South Africa; and to establish long-term legal support, education, and policy advocacy for artists across disciplines."
        <footer style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-style: normal; font-weight: 600;">— Ms Lerato Moloi, LASA Founder & CEO</footer>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Highlight: Andile Yenana's Address</h2>
      <p>The highlight of the day entailed a direct interaction with professionals in the field such as the acclaimed South African jazz pianist and cultural ambassador, Mr Andile Yenana, who spoke about his creative works, particularly musicians in his era where intellectual property was not given much priority by the musicians and artists, but he encourages future artists and musicians to become part of the national intellectual property organisations which now exist such as CIPC and LASO which are instrumental in helping to protect the creations of musicians and artists and in providing a supporting role to the future of the music industry and its creative professionals.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>All in all, the day concluded with much knowledge-sharing of resources and expertise, where music was the key focus in terms of intellectual property where creators were given priority to be given recognition to provide them with essential skills in intellectual property (IP).</p>
